# Caf√© Fausse

The **Caf√© Fausse** full-stack, web application will serve as the digital front door for a fine-dining establishment. It will combine a visually appealing React-based front-end with a robust Flask back-end. A PostgreSQL database will ensure reliable data storage for reservations and customer information. It provides a restaurant website with menu browsing, table reservations, newsletter signups, and a responsive (mobile + desktop) client.

## üõ† Tech Stack

| Layer | Main Tools / Libraries |
|---|---|
| Backend | Flask, SQLAlchemy, Flask-Migrate (or Alembic), PostgreSQL |
| Frontend | React, React Router, CSS / SCSS or styled components for responsiveness |
| Testing | Pytest for backend |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

These are steps to get the project up and running on your local machine for development / testing.

### Prerequisites

- Download and install Python 3.x from this site: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Download and install Node.js / npm from this site: https://nodejs.org/en/download
- Download and install PostgreSQL from this site: https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/

---

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/justinfraz/Cafe-Fausse.git
   cd Cafe-Fausse/Flask-server-merged

2. Create & activate a virtual environment:

py -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

---

### Frontend Setup

For both the standard and responsive clients:

1. Navigate to the client folder:

   ```bash
   cd Reactjs-client-responsive

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install

3. Configure API base URL (if needed):

   ```bash
   For example, configure environment variable like REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running Locally

1. First, start the backend:

   ```bash
   cd Flask-server
   flask run
   Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000

2. Then, start the frontend:

   ```bash
   cd Reactjs-client-responsive
   npm run dev
   Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or whatever port React is serving on).

---

## üîç Running Tests

1. Backend:

   ```bash
   cd Flask-server-merged
   pytest

This runs unit + integration + security tests.

---

## üì° API Endpoints

Backend:

| Method | Endpoint URL |
|---|---|
| GET | http://localhost/customers |
| POST | http://localhost/customers |
| GET | http://localhost/reservations |
| POST | http://localhost/reservations |
| POST | http://localhost/newsletter-signup |

---

## üîê Authentication & Security

- Ensure you handle sensitive data using environment variables (e.g. SECRET_KEY, database credentials)
- Passwords should be hashed (e.g. using bcrypt).  Never store them in plaintext
- Validate all user inputs both frontend & backend (e.g. email formats, required fields)
- Protect endpoints requiring auth (if you have admin routes)
- Sanitize user-supplied content to protect against XSS
- Use parameterized queries / ORM to prevent SQL injection

---

## üöÄ Deployment

- Use environment variables to configure production vs development settings (e.g. database URI, debug mode)
- Build the frontend for production (e.g. npm run build) and serve static assets (either via your Flask server or a dedicated static host / CDN)
- Use a production database (PostgreSQL) with secure credentials
- Setup HTTPS / SSL on server (if deploying publicly)
